1)Composable can be stateful(with holding state) and stateless(without holding state).
2)State hosting is a pattern of moving state to a composable's caller to make a composable stateless.
-single source of truth
-it can be shared with multiple composables
-it also intercepted by callers that can decide to ignore or modify the state and it decouple the state from the composable itself.

State hosting is implementation of unidirectional data flow pattern in compose (UDF).
State hosting allow us provide state to multiple composables.
